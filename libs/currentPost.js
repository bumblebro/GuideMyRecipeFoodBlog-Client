        "I first had gochujang a couple of years back when traveling through Seoul. Man, that sweet-spicy kick really hit me! Nowadays, I use it for everything—from stir-fries to marinades. That little glaze can just deepen flavors to really fit the pork with its richness perfectly.",

  instructions: [
    "First things first, you gotta get that pork shoulder.  About a 3-4 pounder will do the trick.  Pat it dry with paper towels – this helps it get nice and crispy later. Don't skip this step; trust me!",
    "Now, for the rub. In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 tablespoon paprika, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 1 tablespoon onion powder, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Give it a good stir.  Seriously, mix it well. You want an even coating.",
    "Rub that glorious mixture all over the pork shoulder.  Make sure you get into all the nooks and crannies.  It's like giving the pork a spa day, only way better.  It's going to taste amazing.",
    "Next up, you need to prepare your slow cooker.  Spray it with cooking spray – trust me on this one too!  This will prevent sticking, and you don’t want that lovely pork sticking to anything.",
    "Place the rubbed pork shoulder in the slow cooker.  It's a snug fit, right?  Good.  We're slow cooking this beauty for about 6-8 hours on low or 3-4 hours on high.   I usually go with low and slow, let that flavor really develop. You could go for high if you're short on time though.",
    "While the pork is doing its thing (and oh, the things it’ll be doing!), let’s get started on that gochujang glaze.  In a separate bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup gochujang (Korean chili paste), 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 teaspoon sesame oil.  Adjust to taste!  Sometimes I add a little more honey for extra sweetness.",
    "Once the pork is cooked through, it should be so tender that it practically falls apart.  Use two forks to shred it.  Like, really shred it.  We’re talking about tiny little strands of porky heaven. ",
    "Now comes the fun part! Pour that gochujang glaze over the shredded pork. Gently toss to coat every strand.  Make sure it's all nice and saucy – and don’t be shy with that glaze.",
    "Serve it up on some buns with coleslaw, kimchi, or whatever your heart desires.  Get creative with it! You can even make some amazing fries to go along with it!   I like to serve it with a side of some roasted vegetables.",
    "And there you have it!  Slow Cooker Pulled Pork with Gochujang Glaze.  It’s finger-lickin’ good, and it’s so easy, you can even get your little brother to help (maybe not though). It’s amazing! Enjoy!",
